## Rock Paper Scissors
Team members elected to create a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors wherein the user selects from a home menu to either play the computer or to close the application.

Group members pair-programmed all of the code for this project. Debugging was also an (extensive!) equal effort as group members pivoted from an unnecessarily complex buildout to cleaner code that ran a game. 

- 6/14/2022: Framed out file structure.  
- 6/15/2022: Created POCOs. 
- 6/16/2022: Worked on UI and debugged. 
- 06/18/2022: Debugged and pivoted upon realizing that an ENUM required parsing ints to strings for comparison to user input, while simpler code allowed strings to be compared to strings within switches and accomplished our goal of a playable game.  

**Takeaways:** Working with pair programming helped team members catch errors along the way while coding and bounce ideas off one another, allowing members to create the most efficient code possible. This method overall encouraged learning while detailing user experience.
